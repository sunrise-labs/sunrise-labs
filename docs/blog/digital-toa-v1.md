On the 18th September 2023 the [Tai Collective](https://www.taicollective.nz/) team ran their first online learning event of 43 young students across 3 different Islands.

The goal of the event was simple: 
How can we reach more Rangatahi M훮ori and Pasifika to engage them in our digital technology programs and kaupapa? 

We to decided to run an online education event to test this as a method of engaging youth with our digital technologies programmes.

We uploaded six online training programs to the Galaxy Maps platform, 
- One on vector graphics, 
- one on 3D modeling, 
- two on web coding, 
- one on beat production, 
- and one on image manipulation.

We had our community space set up in the form of a Tai collective Discord server.

We had 18 Rangatahi join from our P훮mi site, 16 joined from our Rarotonga site, and 12 joined from our Mauke site.

During the event, we ran into a technical bug in our Galaxy Maps platform that prevented Rangatahi from progressing past the first mission. This was a big letdown to our Galaxy Maps development team who had been working so hard on the platform.

And instead, we distributed our training programs through the Discord server. Students engaged in all our training programs, working on the ones that interested them the most.

Rangatahi created some awesome projects using the skills they learned on the day.

We had prizes to give away for the most missions completed, highest quality project, and most valuable community member. We also had spot prizes for Rangatahi that were working hard as well as helping others.

Overall, the event was a massive success, especially considering that everything was being tried for the first time. It was the first time Rangatahi had used our e-learning platform. It was the first time Rangatahi used our recorded training programs. It was the first digital tour event we'd ever run across three locations all at the same time.

We are really excited for the future of M훮ori and Pasifika Rangatahi and the ability for T훮i Collective to help a new generation of creators and innovators get into digital work. 

The event was suppprted by [ECCT](https://ecct.org.nz/) through the Tai Collective, Rangatahi Champions Funding Project from 2022 to 2023.

Kids get to taste test the different areas

Raro kids where way more into it

### Planned format:
- Has all the kids sign into discord to hangout 
- Have a video channel setup as a digital marae
    - showed the kids how to sign into GM and start a course
- kids would sign in a start a course
- kids would talk to each other to share there experiences and work
- kids would talk to and online facilitator when they needed help

### What went wrong 
- bug with GM meant kids couldnt progress past first galaxy
- internet lag wit communications
- kids didnt lock into the event from the start with headphones

### Improvements  
- onboarding needs to be prerecorded and loaded onto device perhaps a GM map
- kids need to be connecting online instead of in a classroom setting

### Reflections
- Not long after the event Ian visited the Tereora College in Rarotonga and learnt that they would love to be an active participant in the programme but they dont have the infrastructure
    - computers with headphones
    - internet
    - network hardware 
        - to enable good internet access for many connections
